Running Instructions:

This pipeline can be run either in batch (a directory), or one file at a time. 

To run in batch, run a root_pipeline_batch.py as follows:

python root_pipeline_batch.py -i <input directory> -o <output directory> -d <downsampling rate>

Example:
python root_pipeline_batch.py -i C:/Users/danzeng/Sorghum/Roots/batch/ -o C:/Users/danzeng/Sorghum/Roots/batch_out/ -d 6

Running it in this way assumes the folder contains raw files, each with a corresponding .dat file in the same directory, with the exact same name (besides the extension).

Output:

A .csv file in the format

To run file by file:

python root_pipeline.py -i <input file> -o <output directory> -d <downsampling rate>

Optional arguments:
-s shape threshold
-l lower envelope
-u upper envelope
-v verbose

Two programs may need to be rebuilt based on your machine's specs. These are TopoSimplifier and root_traits_auto. If they fail to run (showing an error such as "missing VCRunTime140.DLL"), then follow the instructions below to rebuild the following two repositories:

TopoSimplifier:
https://github.com/danzeng8/TopoSimplifier

root_traits_auto:
https://github.com/danzeng8/root_traits_auto

Download each of these repositories to your machine, and open their Visual Studio solutions (.sln files). In the top of the Visual Studio Window, change the build mode to 'Release' and architecture to x64.

Then, go to Project > Properties. This is where the Windows SDK Version and Platform Toolset will depend on your machine. If you are using Visual studio 2019, then try v142 for the platform toolset (v141 for VS 2017, v140 for VS 2015). Windows SDK version 10.0 is the latest installed version on my machine (a Windows 10), however I have also seen Windows 8 SDK to work instead on older machines (sometimes even if they are Windows 10). Apply the changes in the property window. 

Next, in the Visual Studio menu go o Build > Build Solution. If successful, this will update the .exe file in the main repository directory (called TopoSimplifier.exe and root_traits_auto.exe). Otherwise, keep tweaking the Project properties as in the above - assuming a Windows 8 or 10 machine, there should be some settings which will allow for a successful build.

One more thing:
When downloading this repository, make sure the simpleDictionaryFull.bin file in the TopoSimplifier directory is completely downloaded (ALL 131,072 Kb of it). Also make sure that the tmp directory and its subdirectories are completely downloaded.
